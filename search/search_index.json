This project makes it possible to make automations using the .NET Core (3.1) framework. Why a new application daemon for Home Assistant? There already exists one!? The existing appdaemon is a great software and are using python as language and ecosystem. This is for people who loves to code in the .NET core ecosystem and c#. The daemon will be supported by all supported platforms of .NET core. Pre-Alpha! Expect things to change! This is in pre-alpha experimental phase and expect API:s to change over time. Please use and contribute ideas for improvement or better yet PR:s. Only amd64 (non arm) is currently supported but ARM devices as Raspberry PI will be supported in the near future. The daemon is currently only distributed through Hassio add-on but a docker container and instruction to run locally will be provided in time. Instructions to install plugin you can find //here// Async model The application daemon are built entirely on the async model of .NET. This requires some knowledge of async/await/Tasks to use it properly. The docs will give you tips with do and don\u00b4ts around this but I strongly suggest you read the official docs. Here is a good start to read about async model.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#netdaemon","text":"This is the application daemon project for Home Assistant.
